Joseph Lee Dyk-
stra is writing
this and it is 
a test. This is
being read from
a text file. I 
think it is    
quite nifty.   
One problem is 
if you write  a 
long word, you  
have to wrap   
it. For example
ple: Pnuemono- 
ultramicroscop-
icsilicavolca- 
noconiosis, or 
Poly Vinyl     
Chloride, or   
Dominion Cove- 
nant Church.   
I am currently 
listening to a 
song from the  
album "Welcome 
to the Masquer-
ade" and it is 
called "Look   
Away". The art-
ist is "Thou-  
sand Foot      
Krutch". Well, 
the track just 
switched and I 
am listening to
"Man in the     
Mirror" in the 
album "Blind   
World" by the  
artist "Canon".
Well I think   
this is enough 
text for test- 
ing purposes.  
Joseph out.
