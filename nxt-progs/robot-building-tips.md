# Robot Building Tips

1. Plan
    1. How many motors and where will the be?
    2. How should the NXT brick be oriented?
    3. Where are the wires going and will they get in the way?
    4. Where is the 3rd point going to be attached, and what type of 3rd point?  (E.g. fixed wheel, ball caster)
    5. What sensors, if any, are you going to include?
2. Build
    1. If you are building a normal-driving-around robot then build the motors together then add the brick on top.
    2. If you are building 3 motors so that you can power the wheels and an attachment, then try to keep the 3rd motor accessible.
    3. Make it sturdy!
    4. The best balaced robots have 2 powered wheels and 1-2 free-rolling wheel(s).
    5. Make sure you have good places for your sensors (if any).
3. Test
    1. Make a program so that it accomplishes it's task. If you are not good at programming NXT-G then go to http://nxt-progs.blogspot.com and check out the beginner's programming guide!
    2. Have fun!
